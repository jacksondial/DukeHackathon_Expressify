OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!,surprise
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.,neutral
"Obviously! So, how do we decide?",neutral
"Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should date her",neutral
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.,neutral
"Thats interesting, but check this out. I date her",non-neutral
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction,neutral
"Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.",neutral
Yeah well we should order some food then.,neutral

"And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.",neutral
I love working with designers!,joy
"With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach?",neutral

"Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine",neutral
Yes!!! Oh!!,joy
Hypothetically!,non-neutral
Still.,neutral
If Phoebe were my maid of honor,neutral
Uh-hmm.,neutral
